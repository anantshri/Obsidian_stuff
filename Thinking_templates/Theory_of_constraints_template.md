# Theory of Constraints Ideation Template

## Define the Problem

-   What is the problem that needs to be addressed?
-   Why is it important to address this problem?
-   What are the symptoms of the problem?
-   What are the potential causes of the problem?

## Identify the Constraint

-   What is the bottleneck or constraint in the system?
-   How does the constraint limit the system's overall performance?
-   What is the capacity of the constraint?
-   How much of the system's resources are dedicated to the constraint?

## Exploit the Constraint

-   How can you make the most of the constraint's capacity?
-   What are the best ways to reduce or eliminate any time lost due to the constraint?
-   How can you prioritize work to maximize the impact of the constraint?
-   What are the potential risks or drawbacks of exploiting the constraint?

## Subordinate Everything Else

-   What non-constraint areas can be deprioritized or reduced in order to support the constraint?
-   How can you ensure that the non-constraint areas still meet their necessary requirements?
-   What are the potential risks or drawbacks of subordinating everything else to the constraint?

## Elevate the Constraint

-   How can you increase the capacity of the constraint?
-   What are the potential options for elevating the constraint?
-   How do these options align with the overall goals and objectives of the system?
-   What are the potential risks or drawbacks of elevating the constraint?

## Repeat the Process

-   Once the constraint has been addressed, what is the next bottleneck or constraint in the system?
-   How can you apply the same process to address the next constraint?
-   What are the potential benefits of continuously applying the Theory of Constraints framework to the system?
